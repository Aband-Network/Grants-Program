## Project Overview
### Overview
A social network based on decentralized finance.
###  Project Details
#### Background
Whether it's twitter or tiktok, many users contribute their works and get paid for their creation. However, we will find that traditional social networks,
They all exist in the form of a centralized platform, which makes it impossible for every creator in it to guarantee a reward that matches their influence. With the advent of the web3.0 era,
Social platforms need to delegate more power to users so that they have absolute ownership of their own data. We also found that some social platforms are also connecting to blockchain wallets,
But this is not enough. In the past, the income that belonged to the network platform needs to be transferred more to the users.
This requires the platform to implement more functions on the blockchain, not just the blockchain wallet. In the future, social products that only rely on centralized servers to distribute traffic to users and interfere too much with user behavior will inevitably be eliminated.
#### Why Aband Network?
Before making this product, we researched many blockchain social projects, but unfortunately, they did not fully address the needs of users. Some even simply add a blockchain wallet, and other functions are under the chain,
This is not a web3.0 product,
It is easy to be defeated by traditional social giants. Some products do have many functions on the chain, but ignore the innovation in the field of decentralized finance, and over-require p2p for the chat function and ignore the user experience. We believe that social products naturally have an advantage in the number of users, which other products do not have. If these users can give decentralized finance
With a positive impact, more institutions and individuals are willing to bring funds into the project, and users of social products will inevitably get more interest feedback and more opportunities to realize traffic. We also found that no matter whether it is UNI or SUSHI, there is an extreme lack of usage scenarios for tokens.
There are big problems with this single token economic model.
If we use defi as the underlying economic model in the early days of decentralized social products, it will be a very interesting combination, and decentralized finance and social can promote each other,
Both areas can be healthy development. On the other hand, in most scenarios, users are not very interested in whether their messages will be recorded on the blockchain when chatting. Traditional social networking can achieve data privacy and encryption. On the contrary, their requirements for network speed will be higher. very high. Therefore, we at Aband Network hope to give users sufficient choice. They can use any method to process their own messages, such as information with a relatively high privacy nature, and they can choose a blockchain channel for peer-to-peer transmission.
We developed the Aband Network project, hoping to become a benchmark for the combination of defi and social fields. Social public chains naturally need cross-chains, and only in cross-chain scenarios can they achieve healthy and long-term development, so Aband Network chooses to develop in the polkadot ecosystem, which has great advantages.

#### Design details

##### NPoS

We know that pos is more conducive to the decentralization of the blockchain network than poa, and it is also more secure and reliable. Aband Network will support users to carry out staking and obtain income.
Allowing community users to have more opportunities to participate in network maintenance also greatly reduces the cost of the project side.
##### DEX
In Aband Network, we encourage institutions and individuals to increase trading pairs. Officially create a transaction pair between KSM and BAND, and users will be drawn a certain percentage of KSM as a transaction fee in the exchange of KSM and BAND.
After this part of the transaction fee reaches 18 KSM, the chain will automatically start a program to use this part of KSM for repurchase and destroy BAND.
##### Group and Blog and Server 
Everyone can create a group. Every user who enters the group must add liquidity to the KSM-BAND trading pair and obtain combined tokens as shares at the same time.
Participate in the daily affairs of the group. All rewards for DEX mining will first enter the account of the group, waiting for the DAO to decide on the distribution method. If a user violates the rules of the group, he will lose rewards or voting rights, or even be kicked out of the group directly.
In this group, chatting is charged. Of course, this fee will be adjusted according to the needs of the entire network. The system will decide to charge according to the byte or quantity
All the fees collected will go into the treasury, half of which will be destroyed by itself after entering the treasury, and half will be used by the community

We will create an interactive space for bloggers like Twitter, and we hope that everyone can receive news from a more comprehensive source, not just in their closed circle of friends. This is very valuable. Similarly, each news publisher can also get token rewards from the network according to the positive influence of his news.

We will encourage individuals to provide idle servers for the community to use as mastodon has done, and these servers communicate with each other through the activitypub protocol. The server provider decides how much commission to get from the group. In these servers, users can register and post blogs, and users can also create groups.
In addition, the server provider is free to decide the kyc rules and what information to filter.

###### How to improve the quality of group messages?
A good social software not only gives people enough space for freedom of speech, but also cares about the quality of news. How much valuable information it can provide people determines the stickiness of users to a certain extent.
We found that Telegram is a sufficiently free software, but because of its design flaws, the user experience is insufficient. The improvement of message quality cannot only rely on the self-consciousness of users or the rough intervention of managers.
Instead, it needs a bootstrap that comes from good design underneath. In Aband Network, we allow groups to create subgroups based on a certain topic. In these subgroups, users can ask various professional questions, and the answerers will be rewarded with corresponding tokens.

##### DAO
DAO is the basis for the group to perform all daily affairs, it determines fairness and justice, and fully respects individual rights. DAO allows each group to freely decide everything in the group without external interference. At present, we find that daos-org is doing such a thing, 
and their DAO is very consistent with our original vision.
Thanks for their great work.

##### Multi-asset and wallet
For social networks, multi-asset is an essential function, and we will also seek more parachain project parties to carry out strategic cooperation and support more parachain assets to cross-chain. The use of multi-assets is not just about mutual transfers, we will create more and more usage scenarios. Including likes and rewards. And send candy to group members in the group, etc.
We will also develop our own cross-chain wallet.

##### NFT
NFT is the most practical scenario for social networking. It can be used as a platform's rights and interests, as an identity, or as an ordinary avatar. RMRK is a great NFT standard, Aband Network can use it directly, and will contribute code in the future, if necessary.
##### DATA and Privacy
"Data privacy means full p2p". Are you often misled by such preaching? Yes, this is a false statement. Practice tells us that in the vast majority of chat messages, even 90%, users do not need to pay too much attention to p2p,
On the contrary, they need the support of a centralized server in order to obtain a better experience, such as the message cannot be dropped, the network speed should be fast, and so on. We know that the resources in the blockchain network are precious,
Message on-chain should not be universally allowed. In Aband Network, the chat information between users is encrypted asymmetrically, and only the receiver's private key can decrypt the message. Nodes with stricter requirements,
Messages can be heavily censored, such as censoring terrorism, pornography, and more. But all node servers should follow a basic principle, that is, they cannot store the user's personal chat information, so the user's data can only be stored locally on the client.

###### Information review
As a social software, information censorship is an indispensable function, especially in some areas where the control of speech is relatively strict, such as China. As a global social tool, it should respect the needs of users from different cultures.
As a server provider, you can choose the kyc method, and you can freely decide how to review and filter information. As long as people are willing to register personal information in this server, we have every reason to believe that the existence of this server is reasonable.
You may be wondering how information review can ensure user data privacy, especially in some highly confidential chat messages. In Aband Network, we have made a layer of ingenious design. Among the information with strong confidentiality, such as the private key in the blockchain network,
Users can encrypt it and store it in the ipfs network. In this way, in our social APP, the information flow is always just the hash of the data. This hash is neutral, and there is no data indicating that there is illegal information in it, unless the hash is man-made report,
Then the platform has reason to restrict it. That's right, what we have to do is to minimize the legal risks of the platform and server providers.

###### How to protect blockchain account privacy in a network that requires kyc?

Here, we want to answer a question from users, that is, whether kyc and decentralization are really in opposition. I think in Aband Network, this kind of opposition does not exist. The KYC of the account is to meet the server provider's requirements for information review.
And execute socially relevant blockchain transactions and activities. Here, we divide accounts into multiple categories. Transfers between KYC accounts and non-KYC accounts are completely private and anonymous. Here we use TEE to complete privacy calculations. In other words, the use of tokens is completely decentralized,
Without being affected by KYC, you can fully experience the real decentralized blockchain functions in Aband Network.


##### Smart Contract
Social networks should not be limited to the functions and services provided by project developers. We should pay more attention to the voice of the community and open channels for community developers to participate in providing various interesting functions. Such functions do not necessarily serve Aband Network ,
Just like many smart contracts on Ethereum. The traffic effect they bring is also the wealth of the platform. In fact, more and more traditional social networks are developing their own developer platforms, such as WeChat mini-program development. Aband Network will be a smart contract platform,
Allow more developers to develop smart contracts based on Aband Network.
#### Token use

### Ecosystem Fit
The focus of social networks is not on technological breakthroughs, but on how to use existing technologies to better serve users who enter the blockchain, and how to combine existing decentralized finance to bring real value to users, so that everyone An interesting idea can be realized.
We also found that the Polkadot community has decentralized social networks, such as listen network, such as subsocial, but they cannot solve the essential problems of social networking. They do not serve other Polkadot community networks better, and even some low-level economic models are full of loopholes . without really being able to use the advantages of decentralized finance to
Support the platform so that finance will not pay attention to them. This is destined to have no traffic and financial effects for the project. And Aband Network is doing different things, we believe this will be a very successful social experiment.
